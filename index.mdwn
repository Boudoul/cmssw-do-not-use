This is a test repository to study the feasibility of maintaing CMSSW on github.

# Migration strategy

Migration from CVS repository uses [cvs2git][] via a custom script which
enforces some of the migration choices detailed below. The script itself at the
moment needs to have access to the CVSROOT of CMSSW repository.
The following choices where done when migrating.

* Migrate the full per file-history.
* Migrate tags only for an handful of releases, in particular `CMSSW_5_3_9`,
  `CMSSW_6_1_1` and `CMSSW_6_2_0_pre3`.
* `data` directories are not migrated.
* `docs` directories are not migrated.
* Old subsystems like `Iguana`, `IgProf` (which is now maintained in a separate repository [igprof][])
  and `ISpy` are not migrated.
