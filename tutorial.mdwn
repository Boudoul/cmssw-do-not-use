## Adding a new bugfix / feature to CMSSW.

This tutorial wil guide you step to step from an empty directory to 
a new feature being proposed in the CMS Topic Collector. For more general
questions please have a look at the [FAQ][faq] pages.

### Create a CMSSW area

    > scram project CMSSW_6_2_0_pre7
    > cd CMSSW_6_2_0_pre7/src
    > cmsenv

### Checkout a few packages using git-cms-addpkg

    > git cms-addpkg Tutorial/Test CMSSW_6_2_0_TUTORIAL
    > ls Tutorial/Test/bin
    BuildFile.xml
    > git branch
    from-CMSSW_6_2_0_tutorial

>Notice we had to provide the `CMSSW_6_2_0_TUTORIAL` tag explicitly because
>there is no real release called like that. By default it would simply use the
>current release name (e.g. CMSSW_6_2_0_pre7).

### Create a new topic branch and move to it:

    > git checkout -b my-new-feature
    Switched to a new branch 'my-new-feature'

`git cms-addpkg` behaves like the old addpkg. 
The src directory is populated with just what we asked for (here
`Tutorial/Test`).

### Modify sources:

    > cd Tutorial/Test
    > nedit bin/BuildFile.xml
    > git commit -m "Test feature" bin/BuildFile.xml
    [CMSSW_6_2_X b043f10] Test feature.

> You have just committed to your *LOCAL* copy of the repository.

### Show remote repositories

    > git remote show
    official-cmssw
    my-cmssw

>Git supports multiple remote repository. In particular we will use:
>- *official-cmssw*: read only authoritative CMSSW sources 
>- *my-cmssw*: your personal repository, used to propose changes

### Push all your work to your private github repository

    > git push my-cmssw

You need to *PUSH YOUR changes* to make them available to others in your
private repository.
