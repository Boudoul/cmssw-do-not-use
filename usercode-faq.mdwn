# CMS UserCode Migration FAQs

## What is happening?

Just like CMSSW, UserCode repositories will have to migrate away from
`CVS`. The deadline for the migration is the 31st of July, i.e. after the
Lepton-Photon and EPS. See also [the presentation in the spring CMS
Week][cms-week-presentation].

UserCode areas will **not** be centrally migrated, however we provide scripts
and assistance to migrate them to github, reccomended, or the git / svn service
of your preference.

## Can I stick with CVS?

Unfortunately no. CERN/IT wants to shut down the CVS service since years and
while we have been able to postpone it so far to avoid disruption of Higgs
discovery, the long shutdown removes that excuse. This is however a perfect
time to improve how way of working and get rid of all the complications that
came from using an obsolete VCS like CVS.

## Can't we postpone it further?

No.

## Really?

Yes.

## Ok...

Thanks for understanding. We will try to help as much as we possibly can during
your transition.

## Where should I host my repository?

You are free of hosting your repository on any git / SVN hosting site you
prefer, however given we will use <http://github.com> for the CMSSW code, it's
probably a good idea if you stick with it too.

## How do I migrate to github?

Assuming you already have your own account on github (if not follow the
instructions
[here](http://cms-sw.github.io/cmssw/faq.html#how_do_i_subscribe_to_github)),
the first step is to create a new repository to hold your usercode. 
This can be done by simply going to [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new).

Click on "Create Repository" and note down the URL of your newly created
repository.

Now you want to migrate your old `UserCode` area to git. This can be done
from inside a CMSSW (`CMSSW_6_2_X or later`) release on `lxplus` by doing:

    MYUSERCODE=Eulisse
    cvs2git --blobfile=git-blob.dat --dumpfile=git-dump.dat \
            /afs/cern.ch/project/cvs/reps/CMSSW/UserCode/$MYUSERCODE \
            --symbol-transform="(.*)/:\1-" \
            --use-external-blob-generator \
            --fallback-encoding "UTF8" \
            --username $USER 

This step could take a few seconds or hours, depending on how much stuff you
have in your user area. If you have large datafiles we reccomend split the
repository into two parts, one for the datafiles, one for the actual code.

You can now import your old CVS repository into a new git one you created
on git hub:

    MY_REMOTE=<your-usercode-repository-on-github>
    # setenv MY_REMOTE <your-usercode-repository-on-github> # csh
    # e.g.:
    # MY_REMOTE=git@github.com:ktf/usercode.git
    git init usercode
    cd usercode
    git remote add origin $MY_REMOTE
    cat ../git-blob.dat ../git-dump.dat | git fast-import
    git config http.postBuffer 524288000
    git push --mirror -u origin

In case you have some error, try `git push origin master` before the last line.

Further information about cvs2git can be found at <http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/cvs2git.html>.

## I need a private repository!

First of all, keep in mind that your UserCode area was never private, so you
are asking for something new. If you really want to have a private repository you can 
use CERN/IT provided service at <https://cernforge.cern.ch/cernforge/>. Simply adapt
the above mentioned `MY_REMOTE` variable.

## Do you have any more in-depth FAQs?

Yes, please look at the [Standard git FAQ](faq) or at the [Advanced
Usage](advanced-usage) section.

## How do I prevent people from committing to the old CVS area?

Please [leave us a comment][new-faq-form] and we will make the CVS repository
read-only.

## Does this affect physics notes?

No. They are hosted in SVN and this will continue to be the case.
